# chrono-photo

Chronophotography command line tool and library in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

This tool helps to create chrono-photos like 
[Xavi Bou's "Ornithographies"](http://www.xavibou.com/index.php/project/ornitographies/) 
from photo series or ([later](#how-to-prepare-videos)) video footage.

## Examples

Minimal example:
```
chrono-photo ^
  --pattern "input/image-*.jpg" ^
  --output output/out.jpg
```

> _Note 1:_ The ^ at the end of each line is required for breaking commands into multiple lines (at least on Windows).

> _Note 2:_ You can copy the chrono-photo executable anywhere to use it with convenient paths,
in case adding it to the PATH environmental variable is not an option. 
No further files from the installation directory are required to run chrono-photo.

For more options, see [Command line options](#command-line-options).

## How it works

The basic algorithm to use is selected by option `--mode`.

Three different modes are available: `darker`, `lighter` and `outlier`. 
The first two modes simply select the darkest or brightest value found for a certain pixel among all images.
Calculations are very fast, but control over the result is limited.

The core algorithm of this tool, which is explained in detail below,
is based on outlier detection (`--mode outlier`).
This method offers great control over the result and can handle a far wider range of scenarios.
However, it is also computationally more expensive.

The principle idea is to stack all images to be processes, and analyze the entire stack pixel by pixel
(but see also section [Technical realization](#technical-realization)).

Given a typical use case like a moving object in front of a static background, 
a certain pixel will have very similar colors in most images. 
In one or a few images, the pixel's value may be different, as it shows the object rather than the background.
I.e. among the pixel's color from all images, these images would be outliers.

The idea now is to use these outliers for the output image, if they exist for a certain pixel,
or a non-outlier if they don't. Actually, the algorithm blends the outlier into the background depending on "how much of an outlier" it is.

### Outlier detection

Outlier detection in the current version uses multi-dimensional distance to the median,
and an absolute or relative (lower) threshold provided via option `--threshold` (default: abs. 0.05; `--threshold abs/0.05/0.2`). 
The _absolute_ threshold (recommended, typically < 1) is relative to the per-band color range (i.e. fraction of range [0, 255] for 8 bits per color band),
while the _relative_ threshold (typically > 1) is relative to the inter-quartile range in each band/dimension.

A pixel value is categorized as an outlier if it's distance from the median is at least the threshold.
If multiple outliers are found, one is selected according the description in 
[Pixel selection among outliers](#pixel-selection-among-outliers).

If the distance of the outlier to the median is between lower and upper threshold (the two numbers in `--threshold abs/0.05/0.2`),
the pixel color is blended between background and outlier (linear). 
If the distance is above the upper threshold, the outlier's color is used without blending.

#### Pixel selection among outliers

If only one outlier is found for a pixel, it is used as the pixel's value.

If more than one outlier is found for a pixel, different methods can be used to select among them 
via **option `--outlier`**:
* `extreme`: use the most extreme outlier (the default value).
* `average`: use the average of all outliers.
* `forward`, `backward`: progressively blends all outliers over the background, starting with the first or last, respectively.
* `first`: use the first outlier found.
* `last`: use the last outlier found.

#### Background pixel selection

If no outliers are found for a pixel (or for blending), different methods can be used to select the 
pixel's value via **option `--background`**:
* `random`: Use a randomly selected pixel value, selected among all non-outlier images. The default value, but may result in a noisy image.
* `first`: Use the pixel value from the first non-outlier image.
* `average`: Use the average pixel value of all non-outlier images. Can be used for blurring, but may result in banding for low contrast backgrounds.
* `median`: Use the median pixel value of all images (including outliers!). May result in banding for low contrast backgrounds.

#### Parameter selection

Finding the best options for pixel selection, as well as an outlier threshold that fits the noise in the input images,
may require some trial and error.

In addition to inspection of the produced image, use option `--output-blend <path>` to write a greyscale
image showing which pixels were filled based on outliers (greyscale blend value), and which were not (black).

If there are black pixels inside the moving object(s), the outlier threshold(s) should be decreased. 
On the other hand, if there are white or grey pixels outside the moving object(s), the threshold(s) should be increased
(may happen due to too much image noise, an insufficiently steady camera, or due to motion in the background).

### Technical realization

Holding a large number of high resolution images in memory at the same time is not feasible. 

Therefore, before actual processing, the time-stack of images with (x, y) coordinates
is converted into a number of temporary files, each containing data in (x, t) coordinates.
For example, the first temporary file contains the first row of pixels from each image.

Using these temporary files, all images can be processes row by row, without overloading memory, as explained above.

Actually, the above description is a simplification. Option `--slice` provides control
over how much data from each image goes into each temporary file. The option accepts different forms.
Examples:
* `--slice rows/4`: Writes 4 rows of each image into each time slice.
* `--slice pixels/1000`: Writes 1000 pixels of each image into each time slice.
* `--slice count/100`: Internally determines the amount of data written, in order to create a total of 100 time slices.

The default (`rows/4`) should be sufficient for most scenarios. 

**Higher values** can however be used to reduce the number of temporary files created, 
and to slightly increase the efficiently of compression of these files.

**Lower values** may be necessary when processing really huge numbers of images.
During the actual processing, one entire time slice file is loaded into memory at a time.
As an example, processing 100'000 frames in Full HD resolution with `--slice rows/1` requires loading
`frames * width` pixels (200 megapixels) into memory, which are approximately 600 MB. 
By writing, e.g., only half a row per file (`--slice pixels/960` for Full HD),
memory usage can also be reduces to the half, while producing twice as many temporary files.

## How to prepare videos

See also the tutorial on [Preparing video material](docs/tutorial_prepare.md).

There is no support for direct video file processing _yet_.

To process videos, they have to be converted into a sequence of images by a third party tool.
E.g. with the open source software [Blender](https://www.blender.org/),
using it's _Video Sequencer_. The required settings are shown in the image below
(particularly, see 'Output' in the bottom-left corner).

![Blender-VideoSequencer](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44003176/78508454-58a94500-7787-11ea-9e55-675e88cf14d7.PNG)
